"""Judge git on the argv the shell will execute, not on the string a caller types.

**This exists because a permission rule matches the typed STRING and the shell
executes an ARGV**, and the gap between those two is where #30 lived.
`.claude/settings.json` denies `Bash(git *--output*)`, which closes the naive
spelling and nothing more: the shell reassembles adjacent quoted fragments
before `exec`, so `--out''put=<path>` reaches git as `--output=<path>` while
never presenting the matcher with a contiguous `--output`. Measured, not
reasoned about — `printf '%s' --out''put=/tmp/x` prints `--output=/tmp/x`.
`docs/harness-boundaries.md` records that as an accepted limit and names the
fix: "a helper that spells its own flags, or a rule over the executed argv
rather than the typed string". This is the second. It was `CLAUDE.md`'s
paragraph until the extraction; the pointer moved with the argument, because
this comment names the file to rewrite when the bound changes rather than
merely citing one.

It also closes one thing the rule system provably cannot express. `Bash(git
*ext::*)` passes settings validation and then matches NOTHING — the trailing
`:*` is consumed as the prefix-wildcard form — while `Bash(git *ext::**)` is
rejected at startup. So `ext::`, a git transport that RUNS its argument as a
command, has no expressible Bash deny. It has one here.

**The push half is an ALLOW-list, and that is the whole design (#23).** It began
as a deny-list of dangerous spellings and two review rounds took it apart, each
finding a form nobody had listed: `--force-with-lease=<ref>` (not equal to the
set entry), `--for` (git accepts unambiguous abbreviations), `-fv` (bundled
shorts), `--all` and `--branches` and `--mirror` and `--prune` (no refspec to
inspect), `refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*` (a wildcard destination that includes
`main` and equals nothing), `git push origin HEAD` and bare `git push origin`
(no destination named at all, so nothing can be shown NOT to be `main`).

That is the deny-list trailing the grammar — the exact failure #23 is about,
reappearing inside its fix in parser form. **So the question is inverted:** a
push is refused unless every part of it is recognised. One remote, one refspec
that names a destination, and options drawn from a fixed set. Everything else,
including every spelling nobody has thought of yet, is refused. The three
pushes `/ship` actually makes are pinned in the suite, so over-reach breaks
there rather than in the delivery chain.

**Three things the parser has to do before it can judge anything**, each found
by a reviewer after the previous fix looked complete:

  * **heredoc bodies are data.** `shlex` knows nothing about them, so a commit
    body was tokenised as arguments — refusing an honest commit that quoted a
    push, and only passing the first test because an apostrophe forced the
    fallback path. Stripped first.
  * **operators without spaces still separate commands.** `shlex.split` left
    `--oneline&&git` as one element, so `git log --oneline&&git push origin
    +HEAD:main` never started a second segment and the push was admitted.
    `punctuation_chars=True` fixes it and leaves quoted content alone.
  * **a command substitution is executed, not quoted away.** `git log "$(git
    push origin +HEAD:main)"` is one `shlex` token and two commands to the
    shell. Substitutions are extracted and judged in their own right.

**What a value-taking flag is depends on the SUBCOMMAND**, and defaulting the
other way was a hole: `-m` takes a value for `commit` and takes none for `log`,
so a global skip-list let `git log -m --out''put=<path> --format=%B` walk the
skipped element straight past the check — #30, reopened by its own fix. The map
below is consulted per subcommand and **skips nothing by default**, because the
failure directions are not symmetric: not skipping costs a false positive, and
skipping wrongly costs a bypass.

**The residuals, stated rather than left to be found.** `shlex` resolves
quoting and command substitution is handled, but not *expansion*: a flag
assembled at run time — `F=--output=x; git log $F` — arrives as the token `$F`
and is not seen. Closing that needs the argv after expansion, which no hook is
given. And the value-flag map trails git's options the way any list does; it is
load-bearing only for false positives now, never for a bypass.

Protocol: PreToolUse, matcher `Bash`. Exit 0 and print nothing to allow; print
the deny JSON to refuse. Exit 2 would also block, but the JSON form carries a
reason the caller can read, and a guard that refuses without saying why is one
that gets worked around rather than fixed.

# Flags that reach outside what the grant was for. Matched on a PREFIX, so
# `--exec-path=<dir>` — a directory of binaries for git to run — is the same act
# as `--exec`; an earlier form matched exactly-or-`=` and admitted it, which the
# crude substring deny had been catching all along.
#
# Three of the four write or execute. `--no-index` is the odd one and it is here
# for the same boundary in the other direction: it makes git diff two paths as
# plain files with no repository involved, so `git diff --no-index <secret>
# /dev/null` prints that file to stdout. Measured, not reasoned about — it
# printed this host's ~/.gitconfig. `Bash(git diff:*)` is granted in
# settings.json and in four commands' frontmatter, and Read is bounded by the
# harness, so without this line the read grant is wider than the Read tool it
# sits beside. Raised by Copilot against PR #13; the deny in settings.json is
# beside it as defence in depth, and this is the half that is not a speed bump.
#
# `--ext-diff` and `--textconv` are the fifth and sixth, and they are the
# ones that execute. Neither carries a command itself — they ENABLE a command
# git already has in configuration, `diff.external` and `diff.*.textconv`.
# The `git -c` list below refuses setting those keys inline and never
# refused activating an existing one, which is a boundary with the door left
# open on the other side: a developer host can carry either key already, and
# `.git/config` is writable through the redirection residual this file does
# not close (#20). Measured in a scratch repository — with
# `diff.external` set, `git diff --ext-diff` RAN it and printed its output.
# So `git diff`, `git log` and `git show`, granted everywhere as read-only,
# were host code execution one flag away. Raised by Copilot against PR #13.
#
# `--no-ext-diff` is the safe direction and stays admitted: neither the
# prefix test nor the abbreviation test matches it against these names.

# `.claude/settings.json` denies `Edit(.claude/scripts/**)` and every editing
# command denies the same trees in its own frontmatter — and all of that binds
# the EDITING TOOLS. A `>` on any granted `Bash` command writes what every one
# of those refuses (#20), measured on this repository's own hook: `ls >
# .claude/settings.json`, `wc -l README.md > package.json` and `git log
# --oneline > package.json` were all admitted, and in a scratch directory the
# write landed.
#
# `/review-grok` answered this by denying `Bash` whole, which is available to
# exactly one command: the other four editing commands have fixed helpers as
# their API and cannot. So the rule moves here, where it binds the redirection
# rather than the tool beside it.
#
# **A hook is handed a command, never the frontmatter that granted it**, so the
# set cannot be derived at run time the way `test_grok_helpers.py` derives the
# frontmatter denies from the frontmatter. What stands instead is a test whose
# subject is this list: the suite asserts it covers `MACHINERY_TREES` and every
# tracked root file, so a new tree or a new root file fails the suite until
# somebody decides which side of the boundary it is on — the same shape
# `CLAUDE.md` already describes for the harness suite as a whole.
#
# `.vscode` is here and is not in the suite's machinery set, because
# `tasks.json` runs on folder open and this list is about writes rather than
# about what a command may edit; the suite asserts coverage in one direction
# only for exactly that reason.
#
# `.remember` is here because `.claude/settings.json` denies editing it
# globally — session state no command writes by hand — and `ls` and `wc` are

# `[ \t]*` rather than `\s*`, because a newline between `<<` and its delimiter
# is not a heredoc to bash either. The quote characters are spelled \x27 and
# \x22 so that neither this pattern nor anything quoting it has to escape them.
# **And a WORD may be quoted in PARTS, which matching one alternative could not
# express.** `<<E"OF"` names the delimiter `EOF` to bash and takes its body
# verbatim; the three-alternative form matched `<<E`, left `"OF"` standing where
# the subcommand goes, and `git <<E"OF" push origin +HEAD:main` was admitted
# while bash ran the push. Raised in review; verified allowed. So the word is
# one or more fragments — single-quoted, double-quoted, escaped or bare — and
# `_heredoc_delimiter` below does the quote removal the shell does.
#
# **`$'…'` is a quoting form and reading its `$` as bare was a fail-open.**
# `<<$'EOF'` names `EOF`; taking the `$` for an ordinary character made the
# delimiter `$EOF`, so a script terminating at a real `EOF` line had every
# command after it swallowed as body text — `git push origin +HEAD:main`
# included. Raised in review; verified allowed. `$"…"` is the locale form and
# is listed beside it for the same reason.
#
# **A continuation may split the delimiter itself**, and the word class has to
# say so before anything else can. `<<EO\<newline>F` names `EOF` to bash, which
# removes the pair at the input level; reading the delimiter as `EO` made the
# guard's body start a line early and end a line early, so the real command
# line was swallowed as data and `git <<EO\<newline>F push origin +HEAD:main`
# was admitted. `join_continuations` cannot help here — `strip_heredocs` runs
# on the raw command, before it, and must, because a heredoc body is not a
# command line. Raised in an adversarial audit; verified allowed, on `main` as
# well. `\\\n` leads the alternatives because `\\.` cannot match a newline.
#
# **A quoted fragment ends at an UNESCAPED quote and never spans a line.**
# `<<"E\\"OF"` names `E"OF` to bash; the fragment closed at the escaped quote,
# the scan then ran on across the newline and took the next line into the
# word, and the delimiter came out as nonsense — so `heredoc_spans` found no
# body at all. That direction happened to refuse; the mirror of it, where the

    heredoc bodies, and only `heredoc_spans` passes any. Inside one, a quote
    opens nothing and a `#` starts nothing: the characters are yielded as
    quoted, which is what every consumer of this scanner means by "not a
    command line".

    **One scanner, because both callers were defeated by the same thing.** A
    regex search for `<<` found a heredoc opener inside a COMMENT, so
    `git status # <<EOF` swallowed the real command on the next line before it
    could be judged; and a paren counter that did not know about quotes let
    `git log "$(printf ')'; git push origin +HEAD:main)"` close early, hiding
    the push in the outer token. Both raised in review, both verified allowed.

    `state` is `"single"` inside `'…'`, `"double"` inside `"…"`, `"comment"`
    in a comment, `"data"` inside one of `data`'s spans and `""` elsewhere.
    Comments start at an unquoted `#` that begins a word and end at the
    newline — which is bash's rule, and the reason `git log --grep=#x` is not
    a comment.

    **An ANSI-C word takes a backslash and an ordinary single-quoted one does
    not**, and reading `$'…'` by the ordinary rule desynchronised every
    consumer of this scanner from the position it was on. `$'''` is the
    one-character word `'` to bash — the escaped quote does not close it — so
    `$''' ; git 2>&1 push origin +HEAD:main` runs the push. Read by the
    ordinary rule the word closes at the escaped quote, the quote after it
    opens one that never closes, and the rest of the line is `in_quotes`: so
    `redirection_spans` left `2>&1` standing, `is_boundary` read the glued
    `>&` as a run boundary, and `git` was severed from its own subcommand.
    Raised in review; verified allowed. `$"…"` needs nothing, because a
    locale-quoted word already follows the double-quoted rule this scanner

    exactly as their `$( )` spellings do — the dangerous string is literally in
    the source and only an empty expansion is needed to close the word up. But
    `git push origin $BRANCH` is traffic this repository writes, and deleting a
    WHOLE word would refuse an honest push for naming no destination. So the
    test is adjacency: an expansion touching other characters of its own word
    goes, one standing alone stays. Raised in an adversarial audit, which
    pointed out that the residual named in `docs/harness-boundaries.md` is
    about a value assembled at run time — `F=--output=x; git log $F` — and that
    this is not that.

    The same decision `undecodable_heredoc` records, one construct along, and

    trails bash's, and each gap in one reopens the hole it was written to
    close. `$'\\''` is the shape that forces the question — it is a single
    quote produced by an escape, which desynchronised `substitutions` and sent
    the whole command down the `ValueError` path, where the push allow-list
    does not run.

    **Both forms can fail, and the locale one always does.** `$'…'` can carry
    an escape outside the set `decode_ansi_c` knows, so it fails when it does.
    `$"…"` fails unconditionally, and the word *translated* is why.

    **The translation is a lookup in a catalogue this hook is not given**, and
    the first version of this paragraph named the wrong half of the problem. It
    said `$"…"` is a translated double-quoted string and then refused only the
    expansions inside it — as though `$"safe"` were the word `safe` once no
    substitution was present. It is not: bash resolves `$"…"` through gettext
    against `TEXTDOMAIN` and `TEXTDOMAINDIR`, both ordinary environment
    variables, so a catalogue placed in the checkout decides what the word
    says. Measured with a hand-built `.mo`: `$"safe"` printed `printf`, and in
    command position `$"safe" RAN` **executed** it. The same lookup can return
    `git`. Raised in review.

    So this is the residual `docs/harness-boundaries.md` names — text the shell
    is *told* rather than text it is given — arriving in a construct a caller
    can type literally, and the answer is the one that file already states for

    two ordinary characters and stays. Inside double quotes bash removes it,

    "package.jso?"` names a file with a question mark in it and expands to
    nothing. `shell_positions` is the module's one answer to that question, and
    an escaped metacharacter is counted as unquoted here — over-refusal in a
    position where nothing legitimate writes.

    **`extglob` adds three openers that are not in that set**: `@(`, `+(` and
    `!(`. A shell started with `-O extglob` expands `package.@(json)` to the
    existing `package.json` exactly as it expands `package.jso?`, so each of
    them, unquoted and followed by `(`, counts as a pattern too. (`?(` and `*(`
    were already caught by their first character.) Raised by Copilot.

    which is the point of matching a component rather than a prefix.

    **Compared folded, on every host, because the filesystem decides and not
    the string.** Windows and a default macOS volume look names up without
    regard to case, so `ls > PACKAGE.JSON` and `ls > .CLAUDE/settings.json`
    overwrite the protected file while matching neither set as spelled. This
    hook cannot ask the volume — it has no `cwd` it can trust, which is the
    reason it judges lexically at all — so it folds everywhere, and a Linux
    redirect to a genuinely distinct `Package.json` is refused along with it.
    Raised by Copilot.

    Windows also discards trailing dots and spaces from a component, so
    `package.json.` opens `package.json`; those are stripped before comparing.
    An 8.3 short name — `PACKAG~1.JSO`, `CLAUDE~1` — is the same file under a
    spelling no set can list, so a `~<digit>` component is refused when its
    stem could abbreviate a protected name. Not every such component: Windows
    spells the temp root itself that way (`C:/Users/RUNNER~1/…`), and refusing
    those would take the session's scratch writes with it.

    **An NTFS stream suffix names the same file too.** `package.json::$DATA`
    opens the default data stream — the file's contents — while the component
    as written is not `package.json`. So a component is compared up to its
    first `:`. A drive letter is a component of its own (`C:`), which folds to
    `c` and names nothing here. Raised by Copilot.
