"""Refuse the /review-grok triager every edit `/ship` refuses, in every turn.

**`/ship`'s `disallowed-tools` binds only the turn `/ship` was loaded in**, and
step 5 spawns the triager async, so every triage round after the first starts
in a turn where that list no longer holds — the rounds reading an untrusted
review, holding `Edit`. `docs/harness-boundaries.md` owns the measurement.

**So the boundary sits on the profile, where a turn cannot end it.** This hook
is wired in `review-grok-triager.md`'s own `hooks:`, like
`guard-triager-dispatch.py` beside it, so it judges the triager's edits and
nobody else's.

**It holds no copy of the list.** The trees are read from `/ship`'s
`disallowed-tools` on every call — the `Edit(...)` entries, from the
`ship.md` beside this file — so the list has one owner and a path added there
is refused here with no second edit to forget.

**The triager edits the checkout it was spawned in and nothing else.** The
root is the checkout holding the event's `cwd`; a target outside it — a
sibling worktree, another repository, a temp path — is refused, and so is
any target when `cwd` is in no checkout. Inside it, the target is judged
relative to that root against the patterns, both as spelled and as resolved.

**Matching ignores case on every host.** Windows and macOS file systems do,
so `readme.md` there is `README.md`; on a case-sensitive Linux file system
this deliberately over-refuses a distinct file differing only in case, which
is the safe direction for a boundary. For the same reason the trailing dots,
spaces and `:stream` suffixes Windows drops are folded before matching.

**One question, and another guard answers the rest.** Whether a path is the
file it spells — a link, a junction, an alternate spelling — is
`guard-edit-target.py`'s subject, wired session-wide in `settings.json` and
so in force here too.

**It fails closed, like the dispatch guard and unlike the session-wide two.**
An unreadable event, or a `ship.md` yielding no `Edit(...)` patterns, refuses
the edit: a guard that cannot find its rules and admits everything is no
boundary. Exit 2 is the only code that blocks a `PreToolUse` call.
