"""Run one hook in this interpreter, and prove by the exit status that it ran.

**`run-guard.sh` runs this, and only for an interpreter it did not probe on
this call.** The launcher probes each candidate before it `exec`s one, and it
remembers when the first candidate passed so that the next call can skip the
probe (blueprint-admin#44, blueprint-frontend#62). What the probe established
was true when it was made. By the next call the interpreter may have been
uninstalled or repointed below the floor, and the mark that says it passed
sits where the guarded session can make one — so on that path nothing is
taken on trust, and this file is what replaces it.

**The floor is checked here, in the interpreter that is about to judge**, and
before anything is read from stdin. An interpreter below it leaves with a
status that proves nothing and an event nobody has consumed.

**Three statuses mean this file reached the guard, and they are chosen clear
of what anything else is known to leave with.** A `PreToolUse` hook is
believed on its exit status alone, and so is this file by its launcher — but 0
is also what a stand-in that ran nothing answers, and 2 is also Python's own
answer to a script it could not open. So the guard's status is translated:
`ALLOWED` for its 0, `REFUSED` for its 2 and `ERRORED` for anything else — a
crash, or a guard that does not compile. The launcher turns those back into 0,
2 and 1 and refuses the call on every other status, 0 among them. The Store
alias exits 49, the `py` launcher with no matching runtime exits 103, a
missing command 127; none is one of the three.

**The verdict itself is the guard's and is passed through**: its stdout, its
stderr, and which way its own crash falls. `guard-git-argv.py` argues that
direction for itself, and a launcher that answered differently depending on
whether a mark existed would be a second opinion nobody asked for.

**One thing falls closed here that the `exec` lets through, and it is not a
verdict.** A verdict that could not be written was not delivered, and the
interpreter says so itself, leaving with 120 when its last flush fails. That
is a status that proves nothing, so the launcher refuses, where the same 120
under the `exec` lets the tool run. A guard that cannot be opened is refused
on both paths: `python` answers a script it cannot open with 2.

**Compiled from source on every call, as `python guard.py` compiles it.** No
import and so no `__pycache__`: a cached module under `.claude/hooks/` would be
one more file whose contents decide what the guard does, and that list is
kept at the guards themselves.

**A bare name, resolved beside this file.** The launcher's closed set is what
admits a guard; this file takes the name it admitted and refuses anything
carrying a directory, so the guard and the file that proves it ran come from
one checkout, as the launcher and the guard already do.
