# Run one guard hook with whichever Python this host actually has, exactly once.
#
# **`py -3.12` is the Windows launcher and both hooks were wired to it (#23).**
# `py` ships with Python on Windows and nowhere else: a standard 3.12 on macOS
# or Linux provides `python3` and no `py`, so the command could not start and
# every `Bash`, `Edit` and `Write` call failed before the guard ran. Loud and
# total rather than silent, which is the right direction, and still unusable.
#
# **The order is measured rather than preferred, and it is the whole of what
# this file decides.** On Windows `python3` is present on PATH and is NOT
# Python: it is the Microsoft Store's execution alias, which prints "Python was
# not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store" and
# exits non-zero. So a launcher that probed `python3` first would find
# something on every host and the wrong thing on this one. `py` is probed
# first, exists only where it is right, and `python3` is what is left.
#
# **One `exec`, never a fallback chain.** `py -3.12 … || python3 …` re-runs the
# hook whenever the first invocation exits non-zero for a real reason — and for
# a `PreToolUse` hook a real reason includes printing a deny, so a refusal
# would be emitted twice and the second interpreter would judge the event a
# second time. The interpreter is chosen before anything runs, and the chosen
# one replaces this shell.
#
# **A closed set of hook names, like every helper in `.claude/scripts/`.**
# `settings.json` is the only caller and it names one of two files; a launcher
# taking any path would be a way to run an arbitrary script through the hook
# wiring, which is the shape the fixed-endpoint rule exists to refuse.
