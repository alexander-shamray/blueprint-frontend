# Run one guard hook with whichever Python this host actually has, exactly once.
#
# **`py -3.12` is the Windows launcher and both hooks were wired to it (#23).**
# `py` ships with Python on Windows and nowhere else: a standard 3.12 on macOS
# or Linux provides `python3` and no `py`, so the command could not start and
# every `Bash`, `Edit` and `Write` call failed before the guard ran. Loud and
# total rather than silent, which is the right direction, and still unusable.
#
# **The order is measured rather than preferred, and it is the whole of what
# this file decides.** On Windows `python3` is present on PATH and is NOT
# Python: it is the Microsoft Store's execution alias, which prints "Python was
# not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store" and
# exits non-zero. So a launcher that probed `python3` first would find
# something on every host and the wrong thing on this one. `py` is probed
# first, exists only where it is right, and `python3` is what is left.
#
# **One `exec`, never a fallback chain.** `py -3.12 … || python3 …` re-runs the
# hook whenever the first invocation exits non-zero for a real reason — and for
# a `PreToolUse` hook a real reason includes printing a deny, so a refusal
# would be emitted twice and the second interpreter would judge the event a
# second time. The interpreter is chosen before anything runs, and one probed
# on this call replaces this shell; a remembered one runs as a child, below.
#
# **A closed set of hook names, like every helper in `.claude/scripts/`.**
# Its callers are hook wirings — `settings.json` and an agent profile's
# `hooks:` — and each names one of the files in the `case` below; a launcher
# taking any path would be a way to run an arbitrary script through the hook
# wiring, which is the shape the fixed-endpoint rule exists to refuse.
#
# **The probe is paid once rather than once per call, and the mark that
# remembers it holds nothing (blueprint-admin#44, blueprint-frontend#62).**
# Running a candidate before choosing it is a second interpreter start on every
# `Bash`, `Edit` and `Write` call, and its answer is a property of the host, not
# of the event. So the first call leaves a mark saying that the candidate probed
# first passed, and a later call that finds the mark skips the probe. The mark
# lives under `.claude/cache/`, which the session being guarded can write, so it
# is an empty directory named for that candidate and this file never opens it:
# there is no content to choose a program with, nothing to write through and
# nothing to block on. Whether it exists is all it says, and the name asked
# about is worked out here. A forged one buys a skipped probe of the program the
# probe would have run.
#
# **A remembered interpreter runs as a child and has to prove it judged,
# because an `exec` cannot fail closed.** Once `exec` has replaced this shell
# nothing is left to notice that the interpreter was uninstalled, repointed
# below the floor, or was the Store alias all along: it exits 103, 49 or 127,
# none of them 2, and the tool runs unguarded. So the remembered candidate
# runs `run-guard.py`, which checks the floor in the interpreter that is about
# to judge, runs the guard there, and answers with one of three statuses that
# nothing else produces. Any other status — 0 included — is the call refused
# and the mark forgotten, so the next call probes again. Never a second
# candidate in the same call: the first may have read the event, and the two
# guards `settings.json` wires allow an event they cannot read. The index
# refresh, the one hook here that guards nothing, ignores one.
#
# **What that costs is one refused call when the host changes under a mark**,
# where the probe moved on to the next candidate unnoticed. A mark that cannot
# be removed, because something was put inside it, refuses every call until
# somebody removes it, and says so. And a host whose first candidate is not
# its working one — a `py` with no 3.12 registered, the Store alias with no
# `py` — is never remembered: it pays the probe on every call, as before,
# because a mark that could name a later candidate would be a mark that
# chooses.
set -eu

# **From here this shell leaves with 2 unless a guard's verdict says
# otherwise.** `set -e`, an unset variable and a refused redirection each end
# a shell with a status that is not reliably 2 — 1 under `bash`, 2 under
# `dash` — and so does a refusal printed to a stderr nobody is reading,
# which arrives as SIGPIPE. A `PreToolUse` hook reads every such status as
# leave to run the tool. The two ways past these lines are an `exec`, after
# which the guard's status is the hook's, and a proven verdict below, which
# lifts the trap itself. A signal sent from outside is not covered: it ends
# this shell as it would end the guard.
