"""Let the /review-grok triager dispatch the adjudicator and nothing else.

**The profile cannot say this, and neither can the command that spawns it.**
`review-grok-triager` holds `Agent` because `/review-grok`'s method starts by
dispatching `review-adjudicator`, and a type list inside a subagent's `Agent`
grant is ignored — so the profile admits every type. `/ship`'s deny list
reaches the agents it spawns and refuses the broad built-in types by name, but
it cannot refuse `review-grok-triager` itself, because that is the one type
`/ship` grants. So the triager could spawn another triager: an editing agent
dispatched by one that has been reading an untrusted review, which is the
shape the split between adjudication and application exists to refuse.

**So the rule is one comparison, and it is wired only where it applies.** This
hook sits in the triager profile's own `hooks:`, not in `settings.json`, so it
judges the triager's dispatches and nobody else's: `/ship` spawning the
triager, or a sweep spawning its auditor, never reaches it. A dispatch whose
`subagent_type` is exactly `review-adjudicator` passes; anything else — the
triager itself, a built-in, a missing type, which the harness would default to
`general-purpose` — is refused.

**It fails closed, unlike the two session-wide guards.** They fail open on an
unreadable event because refusing every call would turn a defect in the guard
into a dead session. This one guards one agent's dispatches, so the cost of
refusing is a stopped triage — which `/ship` reports as a step that did not
run — and the cost of admitting is the recursion above. Exit 2 is the only
code that blocks a `PreToolUse` call; any other non-zero exit lets it through.
