#!/usr/bin/env bash
# List the pull requests for one branch — number, state, url, headRefOid —
# and nothing else. Read-only, fixed field set.
#
# **`headRefOid` is published because `ship.md` step 0 decides with it.** That
# step calls a branch finished when the local tip is still the head the pull
# request merged, and only the pull request knows that oid.
#
# **Exists because `gh pr list` reaches the review feeds (#56).** Removing
# `Bash(gh pr view:*)` from the three commands that held it was not enough:
# `gh pr list --json reviews,comments` returns the same review bodies and issue
# comments, in full, for every pull request at once. Measured, not reasoned —
# `gh pr list --state all --limit 1 --json number,reviews` on this repository
# returned a 2,457-character Copilot review body. So the grant those commands
# kept for the harmless job of finding a branch's PR was a complete bypass of
# all three author-filtering helpers.
#
# That is the same defect as the `gh pr view` one, one subcommand over, and it
# is why the test that pins this invariant now enumerates the *commands that
# can reach the fields* rather than the one spelling that was fixed first.
#
# The branch is optional and defaults to the checkout's current branch. When
# given it is shape-checked, because it reaches an argument position: a value
# starting with `-` would be read as a flag, and `gh pr list` has flags that
# change what is returned.

#
# Both sides of the comparison are properties of the filesystem: `gh repo view`

# comparison below then matches every row whose head repository is absent,

# filter would admit a stranger's pull request precisely when it could not
# establish whose it was, which is the fail-open direction.

# **`--head` matches a branch NAME, so this returned every pull request that
# has ever used it, in whatever order the API gave (#24).** A branch name
# reused after a merge — ordinary, and nothing in `/branch` prevents it —
# leaves an older `MERGED` row beside a newer `OPEN` one. `/ship` step 0 reads
# a `MERGED` row as proof the branch is finished and tears the workspace down;
# `/pr` has the mirror of it and creates a duplicate. That is the worst answer
# this chain can give: not a refusal and not a red check, but a confident
# teardown of live work, justified by a true statement about a different pull
# request.
#
# So the selection is bounded here rather than left to the caller: the rows are
# filtered to this repository, sorted, and **the newest alone is returned**.
# `ship.md` already says "the newest row" in as many words; this is what makes
# that true. Sorted by `number`, which GitHub assigns monotonically per
# repository, so it needs no date parsing to be a total order.
#
# **And the page is bounded where the field set was not (#22).** `gh pr list`
# defaults to 30 and has no `--paginate`; a popular branch name across forks
# can fill it, and this helper's own repository filter runs AFTER the page is
# taken — so the row that matters could be the one left off. `--limit` pages
# internally, and a response holding exactly the limit is refused rather than
# returned, because a truncated listing here is a wrong answer and not a
# smaller one.

# PR this chain opens targets `main`, so no other base is its PR. Raised by

# **The newest row can still be a previous incarnation of the branch.** Sorting
# settles a reused name once the new PR exists; before that, the old `MERGED`
# row is the only row, and `/ship` step 0 read new work on the reused branch as
# already delivered. Raised by Copilot.
#
# The local branch says which incarnation this is, and **the merge commit is
# the test, not the PR's head**. The first form dropped a merged row whenever
# its head was a strict ancestor of the tip — which is equally true of a branch
# recreated from `main` and of the ORIGINAL branch with commits added after its
# PR merged. `ship.md` stops on the second (the work is past a merged PR and
# needs a decision), and dropping the row sent it to `/pr` instead. Raised by
# Copilot. A branch recreated from a `main` that contains the merge carries the
# PR's merge commit; the original branch with commits on top does not. So the
# row is dropped only when that merge commit is an ancestor of the tip. A merge
# commit this checkout has not fetched, or no local branch at all, leaves the
# row as reported — the stop is the safe answer when this cannot be shown.
# An open row is never dropped: an open PR is the branch's current one by
# definition.
#
# **Merged only, never closed.** A PR closed unmerged is somebody's decision
# that this branch does not land, and `/ship` stops on it; dropping the row
# after one more local commit sent the run to `/pr` to open a replacement over
# that decision. Raised by Copilot.
