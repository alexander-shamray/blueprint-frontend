"""The review loop's helpers, tested where they decide.

The scripts in this directory carry the judgements the whole /ship loop and
both sweeps rest on, and until this suite existed none of them had a test.

**Almost every subject below shipped wrong**, and each of those is reproduced
as a case that fails against the old behaviour — a gate only ever observed
green is one nobody has established is looking at anything, which is the rule
the .github/**-gate suites are already written to. One subject is the
exception and is marked as such: the label helper's confinement never shipped
wrong, and its cases keep a closed grant closed rather than catching anything.

**No count opens this list, in this file or in the two that mirror it.**
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `docs/testing.md` enumerate the same subjects,
and the numeral that used to lead all of them said four, then five, then six,
and was stale again inside the pull request that added the last of them. A
figure restated in several places goes stale in all of them at once; the
enumerations are what a reader compares.

**`CLAUDE.md` was a holder of this list and no longer is.** The extraction
folded its commands section into `docs/testing.md`, which carries the
issue-by-issue subjects alone now — measured, `CLAUDE.md` contains none of
them. One fewer copy to drift, and one fewer file to send a reader to for a
list that is not there.

**The regression negatives are paired with positive controls, and those are not
decoration.** A negative that passes because a pattern matches *nothing* is
indistinguishable from one that works — a trap this suite fell into once, when
`\\b402\\b`'s negatives all tested digits *around* the number and none tested it
alone.

What is under test, and which issue each half closes:

  #120  the usage-limit pattern missed `402 Payment Required` / `usage balance
        exhausted`, so an exhausted prepaid balance took the FAIL path and spent
        a ledger slot on a review that never started.
  #69   the did-it-run check was a deny-list of three stop reasons, so a
        reviewer that ran out of output or turn budget reported as a clean pass.
  #51   the ledger printed `0` — "nothing spent" — on its own trust-check error
        path, re-arming the twelve-check cap.
  #59   nothing made the reservation happen, and nothing tied it to the model
        call it accounts for — and the first fix for that could still aim the
        reservation at a different pull request.
  #75   the sweeps' worktree shape check was not the direct-child check its
        comment claimed, because `?` matches `/` in a bash `case`.
  #75   `gh label create` is create-or-overwrite, so the grant reached any
        label in any repository. This one is the odd entry: it never shipped
        wrong. It is a grant closed by moving it into a helper, and these cases
        are what keep it closed rather than what caught it.
  #75   `gh issue create` was the same shape one helper over: `--repo` and
        `--label` free under a prefix grant, and a `/`-title filed as a path
        because the grant could not carry an env prefix. Closed the same way,
        and the confinement never shipped wrong either; the title did, and
        the case that reads the child's environment is the one for it.
  #17   egress from the reviewer was unrestricted, so the OAuth session that
        crosses on the fallback path could be posted anywhere. Closed by an
        internal network and a CONNECT-only proxy; these cases keep every
        credential-bearing `docker run` on that network, which is the whole
        of the confinement's width, and `test_egress_proxy.py` beside this
        file exercises the proxy itself at the socket, which is its depth.
  #56   /review-copilot read three comment feeds and filtered none of them,
        holding `Edit`, in a loop /ship runs unattended. The cases cover what a
        feed helper admits, that a dropped item's BODY reaches neither stream,
        and that no command can reach those feeds outside the fixed helpers.
  #33   the deny list guarded the helpers and not the files that grant them.
        The cases cover every control-surface path in both spellings, that no
        rule is spelled `Write(`, and that the worktree root is never denied —
        the over-reach that would deny editing the repository itself.
  #52   grok-review.sh printed the reviewer's whole transcript to the caller's
        context, and printed two reviewer-controlled fields on its rejected
        path after that was fixed. The cases enumerate every legitimate read of
        the result file and refuse any other, including a widened one.
  #57   the sweeps' de-duplication gate treated any open issue as tracking, so
        a stranger could suppress a finding and end the sweep. The cases cover
        both copies of the gate and every phrasing it has retired.
  #140  the Grok ceiling was six in `ship.md` and twelve in both helpers, so
        nothing refused a seventh paid check. The cases cover the declared
        ceiling, that `grok-review.sh` DERIVES it rather than restating it, and
        the migration — a row posted under the old ceiling is still read as
        spent, which is what stops the fix re-arming the cap it tightens.
  #60   two commands stated editing boundaries their grants did not enforce.
        The cases read every tracked tree and every tracked root file from
        `git ls-files` and assert each is denied, because the alternative is a
        list that rots the way every deny-list here has.
  #30   `git log --output=` is an arbitrary file write that reads as
        inspection, and the settings deny matches only the unquoted spelling.
  #23   the push deny-list enumerated spellings, and git's refspec grammar is
        larger than any list. Both are the argv guard's, and its cases are the
        longest set here because two review rounds took the first design apart:
        bundled shorts, abbreviations, wildcard destinations, pushes naming no
        destination, heredoc bodies read as arguments, command substitutions
        read as inert.
  #150  what suppresses a sweep finding was prose in two files. The cases cover
        the helper's three exit codes, that neither sweep can read an issue's
        author at all, and that the one legitimate output stays writable.
  #181  a path deny is matched on the SPELLING, so an edit through a link
        inside an allowed tree lands where no deny has judged it. Its cases
        live in `test_edit_target_guard.py` beside this file, which the same
        discover picks up — a link into a denied tree, a link out of the
        checkout, a denied tree spelled as ITSELF (admitted, because the guard
        holds no copy of any deny list), and a checkout reached through a link
        (admitted, or every edit in a worktree under a linked temp root would
        be refused).

**This inventory is a third copy of a list `ci.yml` and `docs/testing.md` also
keep, and it went stale exactly as a redundant copy does** — it ended at #57
while the classes closing five more sat in this file. Reconcile it with those
two, or the next reader of the suite gets the shortest version. It was a fourth
copy until the extraction folded `CLAUDE.md`'s commands section into
`docs/testing.md`; removing a copy is the only fix for this shape that does not
itself need maintaining.

Two rules the suite is written to, both of them this repository's:

  *The engine under test is the engine that ships.* Every pattern assertion
  shells out to the same `grep -E` the scripts call. Re-implementing the regex
  in Python's `re` would be a second specification, and a hand-written double
  cannot disagree with itself.

  *A declared pattern needs a test whose subject is where it is APPLIED.* A
  pattern declared once and then quietly not used, or used alongside a second
  literal copy, is the drift `SOURCE_INPUTS` was invented for. So the pattern
  cases are paired with structural cases over the call sites.

Run: py -3.12 -m unittest discover -s .claude/scripts
Needs bash, grep, git and jq on PATH; needs no network, no Docker, no gh
and no SDK. `git` because one case drives a real worktree round trip, and
`jq` because the did-it-run verdict is parsed rather than matched.

    a suppressed candidate used to leave a clean round, it ended the sweep and
    reported convergence.

    **A maintainer-applied label was a second sufficient condition and is not

    looked like a maintainer's touch; but a label is applied to an issue rather
    than to an issue's contents, and the author can rewrite the body afterwards
    while it stays. Authorship cannot be edited, which is why it is the whole
    test. The cases below pin that the weaker signal stayed retired.

    predicate is prose that an agent follows, not code that runs, so these
    cases cannot prove the gate is applied — only that both files still state
    it and that neither has drifted back to the unconditional rule. The

    failing-check stop, `gh pr create --repo <other> …` chose a repository, a

    real finding and reports convergence — worse than a missed filing, because
    a clean round is what stops the loop.

    That fix was prose, in `security-sweep.md` and `bug-sweep.md`, and the only
    thing enforcing it was `BothSweepsAgreeOnWhatSuppresses` — a drift check
    honest about being one. It pins that both files still SAY the rule; it
    cannot establish that a sweep ever applied it to an issue.

    **The rule implemented here is authorship alone, and #150 as filed asked for
    more than that.** It described "the owner opened it or a maintainer labelled
    it", which was the rule when it was written; a later review round asked what
    a label proves and retired it, because a label is applied to an issue rather
    than to its contents and the author can rewrite the body afterwards while
    the label stays. Implementing the issue verbatim would have reopened what
    that round closed — the command file is the specification, not the ticket.

    Both are the same defect in different grammars: **a permission rule matches
    the typed string and the shell executes an argv.**

    #30 is a write primitive that reads as inspection. `Bash(git log:*)`,
    `Bash(git diff:*)` and `Bash(git show:*)` are auto-approved as read-only and
    are not: all three take `--output=<path>`, with `--format=` choosing the
    bytes. `.claude/settings.json` denies `Bash(git *--output*)`, which closes
    the naive spelling only — the shell reassembles adjacent quoted fragments
    before `exec`, so `--out''put=` arrives at git intact while never showing
    the matcher a contiguous `--output`. **That reassembly is measured, not
    assumed**: `printf '%s' --out''put=/tmp/x` prints `--output=/tmp/x`.
    `CLAUDE.md` had carried it as resting on documented semantics because the
    earlier probe was refused by the classifier rather than executed.

    #23 is the push deny-list. Two broad allows pair with a list of exact
    spellings, so `git push origin +HEAD:main` — a force push to main carrying
    neither `--force` nor the literal `origin main` — is auto-approved, along
    with five more. Enumeration trails git's refspec grammar forever, so the
    guard parses the refspec and judges three properties instead.

    **The hook is the mechanism `docs/harness-boundaries.md` names as owed** —
    "a rule over the
    executed argv rather than the typed string" — and the cases below are what
    establish it is looking at anything. Measured in the harness too: the hook

    `py` ships with Python on Windows and nowhere else: a standard 3.12 on

    start and every `Bash`, `Edit` and `Write` call failed before the guard
    ran. Loud and total rather than silent, which is the right direction, and
    still unusable.

    **The `harness` job could not have caught this and still cannot.** It runs

    platforms and the wiring through `settings.json` on none. A green matrix
    says the guards are correct, not that they run. These cases are the subject
