# Fork /branch step 5's worktree under .claude/worktrees/, and nothing else.
#
# The whole command is fixed here: `git worktree add --no-track -b <branch>
# <path> origin/main`. A `Bash(git worktree add:*)` grant would buy that and
# also `-B`, which does not create a branch but **resets** an existing one to
# the start point — the operation `.claude/settings.json` denies as
# `git branch --force` and `git branch -M`. A grant that reaches around the
# deny list is worth more than the deny list, and a prefix rule cannot exclude
# a flag: see git-switch-existing.sh, where the flags were shown to combine.
#
# `--no-track` is part of the fixed command rather than a caller's choice. The
# start point is a remote-tracking ref, so without it the new branch's upstream
# becomes origin/main and /pr never sets the right one. Checked at the pin:
# `git worktree add -h` lists `--[no-]track`, and a real add with it produced a
# branch with no upstream.
#
# origin/main is fixed for the same reason. Step 5 forks only from the fetched
# base, and a caller-supplied start point would be one more thing to validate
# for the sake of a case this command does not have.
