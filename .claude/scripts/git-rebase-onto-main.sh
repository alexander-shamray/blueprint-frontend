# guards live here rather than in a permission rule because each is a fact
# about the checkout: the branch is the one in hand, it is not main, the tree
# is clean, and the remote carries nothing the work did not start from.
# `.claude/settings.json` denies the raw force push, and that deny is untouched.

# Four modes, because a conflict is the case rebase is here for. `start`
# leaves a conflicted rebase in progress rather than aborting it: backing out
# would send the caller to the merge commit this repository stopped making, so
# the resolution lands in the replayed commit and the history stays a line.
# `continue` publishes once the caller has resolved and staged. `publish` is
# the retry when the replay finished and only the push failed, and `abort` is
# the way out without a raw `git rebase` grant.
