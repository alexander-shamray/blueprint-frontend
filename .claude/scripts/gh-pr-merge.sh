# Merge one of THIS repository's pull requests with a merge commit, bound to a
# named head, and nothing else — `/ship` step 7's one merge and no other.
#
# **`Bash(gh pr merge --merge:*)` is a PREFIX grant, so a trailing flag is
# inside it (#16).** `gh pr merge --merge <n> --admin` bypasses the failing-check
# stop that step 7 treats as mandatory: a pull request merged past red checks by
# a chain whose report says the checks gated it. `ship.md` argues this at length
# and what stood was visibility rather than prevention — step 7 reports the
# literal invocation it ran, so the claim is checkable rather than enforced.
#
# It also explains why a session could not simply write this helper: a session
# able to add `.claude/scripts/gh-pr-merge.sh` could also edit the one it is
# about to invoke, which would make every fixed endpoint in the chain a
# fiction. So this arrives as a human's change to a reviewed file, with the
# raw grant withdrawn in the same commit, which is the only way it means
# anything.
#
# **`--match-head-commit` is a required ARGUMENT here, not an optional flag.**
# `ship.md` calls it "the only guard in this step that fails closed" and then
# relied on prose to make it present. Without it the green verdict and the
# merge are two reads of a moving target: a push landing between them merges a
# commit whose checks never ran. A helper that can be called without it is a
# helper that will be.
#
# The method is fixed to `--merge`, which is this repository's shape — every
# entry in `git log --merges` reads `Merge pull request #n from …`. `--squash`
# discards what `/commit` and `/pr` spend their effort producing, and is not a
# choice this endpoint offers.
